# Clojure Examples for OCI DBTools

#### What is this project?

1. In general, this project shows examples using Clojure to call other Java libraries.
2. The specific examples show how to use parts of the Database Tools packages from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Java SDK.

#### What is Clojure / Why use it?

This description won't do it justice, but at a high level [Clojure](https://clojure.org/about/rationale) is a Lisp dialect written to be compiled and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Lisp dialects are written in prefix notation (operator generally precedes the operands) and nested calls are `(wrapped in sets of (parentheses))`. For example a adding two integers might appear as `(+ 40 2)`. Operators are not limited to two operands. `(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)` is perfectly valid. Clojure forms can be nested so `(* 3.14 (* 2 2))` should work fine. Check out the [project documentation](https://clojure.org/about/rationale) for a more complete description.

Working on a problem with new constraints and learning to look at it from a new perspective is benefical. Using Clojure to exercise the OCI Java SDK is also practical (see "What is this project?") for understanding how any Clojure developer might do this.
